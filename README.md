## required **Mutation Annotation Format (MAF)** file

### Masked Somatic Mutation analysis

`maftools` provides various functions to perform most commonly used
analyses in cancer genomics. This package attempts to summarize,
analyze, annotate and visualize MAF files in an efficient manner from
either **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)** sources or any in-house
studies as long as the data is in **MAF** format.

[DOI:10.18129/B9.bioc.maftools](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/maftools.html)

Such cohort-based large-scale characterizations often produce large
amounts of data in the form of *somatic variants* containing
**single-nucleotide variants (SNV)** and small insertion/deletions
(indels). Somatic variants provide baseline data for many analyses, such
as **Single Nucleotide Polimorphism (SNP)** types, driver gene
detection, mutation frequencies, somatic interactions, visualization,
and estimation of tumor heterogeneity, applied by the package
employment.

### Installation

Install from `BiocManager` package

```{r}
BiocManager::install("maftools")
```

```{r}
library(maftools)
```

##### **Required files**

-   MAF files - can be obtained from TCGA or gz compressed.

-   here we downloaded the MAF file of LUAD cohort from TCGA (GDC
    portal)

```{r}
library(TCGAbiolinks)
```

```{r}
library(DT)
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
luad_maf <- GDCquery(project = "TCGA-LUAD", 
                     data.category = "Simple Nucleotide Variation",
                     data.type = "Masked Somatic Mutation",
                     access = "open")
```

```{r}
GDCdownload(luad_maf,method = "client")
```

```{r}
luadmaf <- GDCprepare(luad_maf)
```

Now, we have all genes with mutation types in LUAD cohort along with
features data. SNP mutations are detectable in the output table, which
can be separated based on *Variant_Classification* column in *luadmaf*
table resulted from `GDCprepare` function.

```{r}
head (luadmaf)
```

```

We also access to altered alleles and substitutions' position in each
gene, indication nucleotides and amino acid exchanges in columns:
*HGVSc*, *HGVSp*, and *HGVSp_Short*.

```

6 c.551G>T  p.Trp184Leu p.W184L  
```

##### **Reading MAF file**

-   `read.maf` function reads and summarizes MAF files in various ways,
    and stores as a MAF object.

-   It is recommended to provide annotations associated with samples in
    MAF.

-   Here I read MAF file of LUAD cohort based on an object resulted from
    `GDCprepare` function because there are sample barcodes annotation
    in it.

```{r}
LUAD <- read.maf(maf = luadmaf)
```

```         
#Validating

> sample summary

```{r}
sample <- getSampleSummary(LUAD)
```

> Gene summary

```{r}
gene <- getGeneSummary(LUAD) 
```

> Recommended clinical data associated with each
> sample/Tumor_Sample_Barcode in MAF.

-   Here I get the linicalData from MAF file resulted from `read.maf`
    function. Another way is to obtain clinical data frame from GDC
    portal using `GDCquery` function.

```{r}
clin <- getClinicalData(LUAD)
```

### **Analysis**

#### Somatic Interactions

Interaction between pair genes using `somaticInteractions` function
based on:

-   **Co-occurance**- co-occurance frequency - both genes are often
    mutated together.

-   **Mutually exlusive** - One gene is mutated, the other gene is not.

Useful for identification of relationships between genes based on their
mutation patterns across a popularion of samples. Highlights potential
functional connections between the genes.

-   Significance customization -- *P.Value \< 0.05 or 0.01*

```{r}
somaticinter <- somaticInteractions(maf = LUAD, top = 20, pvalue = 0.0
```
